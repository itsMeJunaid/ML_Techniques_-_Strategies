# ML_Techniques_-_Strategies

This notebook provides a detailed walkthrough of advanced machine learning techniques, including Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, CatBoost, and LightGBM. It also covers essential topics like hyperparameter tuning using Grid Search, Random Search, and Bayesian Optimization. Furthermore, the notebook delves into ensemble methods such as Stacking, Bagging, and Boosting, ensuring a well-rounded understanding of these powerful approaches.

With an emphasis on both theory and practical implementation, the notebook demonstrates the use of a dummy dataset for clear and reproducible results. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques, including correlation heatmaps, target distribution visualizations, and summary statistics, provide insights into the dataset. Model evaluation metrics like cross-validation, ROC-AUC, precision-recall curves, and F1 scores are thoroughly explained to help users gauge performance effectively.

This notebook is ideal for machine learning practitioners looking to elevate their skills and understand the nuances of advanced algorithms. Whether you're preparing for a competition or working on real-world projects, this guide offers the clarity and depth needed to succeed.
